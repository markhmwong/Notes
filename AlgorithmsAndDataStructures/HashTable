Associative array implementation
  - Uses a hash function to discover the index to a value, possibly that of an array
  - Collisions between keys are possible. This is when the hash function computes a key that already exists.
    Solving Collisions
      collisions can be reduced by having a better hash function
      chaining - a linked list/array or a collection of elements at each key
      open addressing
        linear probing - a strategy used when we have more values than indexes. It works by using the next available position in the array.
      double hashing - uses two hashing functions. The second hashing function is only used when the key from the initial hashing function is not vacant.
      2-choice hashing
      hopscotch hashing
      robin hood hashing
      cuckoo hashing
      coalesced hashing
