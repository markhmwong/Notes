#Economics via First Principles

People make stuff
People want stuff
The more people want stuff the more valuable it becomes
To get stuff you want people trade valuable stuff for valuable stuff
Money is a type of stuff that many people want
People want money so they can get the stuff they want

Deflation
The MORE stuff you want, which money enables you to get, the MORE VALUABLE it becomes

Inflation
The LESS stuff you want, which money enables you to get, the LESS VALUABLE it becomes
